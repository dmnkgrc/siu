Setting up SMU **is super simple**

### Pre-requisites

- [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
- Bash, zsh, or fish

## Installation

<CodeBlock class="mt-4" language="bash" code={`brew install dmnkgrc/smu/smu`} />

## Create your first project

Projects are loaded from `~/.smu/projects` and they should be YAML files

Here is a super simple example:

<CodeBlock
	class="mt-4"
	language="yaml"
	code={`name: 'Demo'
description: 'This is a demo project.'
steps:
- description: 'Install Node and Pnpm'
  run:
    - brew: fnm pnpm
- description: Install Neovim
  run:
    - brew: neovim
    - pnpm: neovim
    - note: "Notes are great for giving more context about what's going on."
  `}
/>

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

- Read the [configuration section](/reference/configuration) for more information on the configuration options
